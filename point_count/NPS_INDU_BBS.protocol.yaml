  Description: >
    Fifty (50) roadside bird survey points are visited once each year as part
    of the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NABBS).

    At each stop, a 3-minute point count is conducted, during which, every bird
    seen or heard within a 0.25-mile radius is recorded. Surveys start one-half
    hour before local sunrise and take about 5 hours to complete.
