    Methods used before 2013 at ISRO.

    Points were approximately 0.4 km (¼ mi) apart, and each had a tagged tree
    associated with it to help in relocating the site each year. Points were
    visited once annually between 0530 (approximately ½-hour before sunrise)
    and 1000 EDT by one skilled observer and usually one recorder. All routes
    were completed between 10 June and 30 June. Temperature, cloud cover, and
    wind were recorded at each point. Unlimited radius point counts were five
    minutes in duration, during which time all species were recorded and
    categorized as “seen,” “heard,” or “flyover.” Data were recorded in
    one-minute intervals. Birds not heard or seen during the five-minute count
    but present at a census point before or after the count period, or while
    walking between points, were recorded as “miscellaneous.” Miscellaneous
    species were not included in the data analysis.
