    1982–1983, 1998–2004
      Breeding bird surveys (BBS) were conducted in 1982 and 1983 along 24.5-mile
      portions of the lower St. Croix (lower river) and Namekagon rivers,
      respectively.  These BBS routes were resurveyed during 1998 using the same
      methods, which followed those of the US Fish and Wildlife Service’s Breeding
      Bird Survey (Robbins 1967) with the following exceptions:
        1)	These were river routes instead of road routes.
        2)	Instead of an automobile, a motorized boat or a canoe was used on
                the lower river or the Namekagon, respectively.
        3)	The count was conducted on two days because the slower means of
                travel prevented it from being performed on one day.
        4)	Locations of stops were determined by marks on a map depicting
                0.5-mile separation from previous stops.
        5)	Each stop was not a stationary point but was instead a point at
                which the count was begun.  The boat or canoe was allowed to
                drift until the three-minute count period ended.

      The Namekagon route starts at the County K Landing in Washburn County and
      ends at the Namekagon Trail Bridge in Burnett County. The route began at
      4:50 a.m. on 23 June 1998 and ended at Howell Landing at 9:15 a.m.  We
      continued at 5:00 a.m. 24 June.

      The lower river route on the St. Croix River consisted of 53 stops.  It
      started 1 mile below the dam at St. Croix Falls in Polk County and ended
      at the St. Croix Boomsite Park just north of Stillwater, Minnesota.  This
      survey was conducted on 17 June starting at 4:42 a.m. and ended at Somerset
      Landing at 8:09 a.m.  The survey continued on 18 June at 5:28 a.m. and
      ended at 8:34a.m.

      Two additional routes were added in 2000 (SACN, UNAM), one in 2003 (USAC),
      and one in 2012 (MSAC).

    2005
      5- and 10-minute count duration. Five-minute counts on one transect (USAC)
      only.

    2006–2007
      5-minute count duration.

    2008
      Surveys conducted by anchoring at fixed locations, 6-minute counts, GLKN
      protocol distance bins used.
